# EnglishAimlessly2

I really love reading books, and since I study English and I really fancy it, I learn new words everyday, it is so difficult to keep track of what words I learned and practice them consistently. I really like this program, it helped me alot to learn new vocabularies. But the main reason for developing this app is to make sure that I have completed WPF courses and after this I really felt confident to continue and learn more about that.
